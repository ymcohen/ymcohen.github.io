Hi! I am  YMCohen, and this is my webpage. I am not very good at coding, and just getting used GitHub. I was confused at first about how to make a website, but I did it! Either way, you can contact me by using the 'thingy' at the bottom. I'll start writing more, don't worry. Kind of. 
  </p>
      
<p class="body1" >
Log number 2! This time, I am trying to make sure the css is good. And I'm trying to link the header, but whatever. Maybe soon I will do some more JS animation. <br> Hey! Guess what! there are apparently a few other Y. M. Cohen's out there, with real businesses, so I hope I don't get into a lawsuit with this. Whatever. Who cares?</p>
<p class="body1" >
Log number 3; Day number 3! This is the third day that my website is up and running. Woo Hoo! <br>
So, today I've worked a bit on the styling (I want it to look nice), and I've worked on adding my new <strong><a href="/music.html">Music Page!</a></strong> I'm really proud of myself, so... Go Mee!!!! <br>
Now that I think about it, this should probably be on another page. Something like... /blog.html! Maybe later. <br> Oh, you know how annoying it is when the stylesheet takes a really LONNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG time to effect the page? It's really annoying. Like, really. <br> Come ON!!! UPDATE ALREADY!!! </p>

<p class="body1" >
This is number 4! Can you beleive it? Now my blogs are getting longer. We'll have to make an index, and set it up properly. <br> if you want to see my testing site, go to <a href = "/test.html"> https://ymcohen.github.io/test.html</a>. That's where I'm testing out the audio options. I wnat to make it easier to modify with JS. And that brings me to my second announcement: Drumroll, please....<br> I have added JS to my website. If you don't see anything, then good for you, because I didn't use it for anything, I just tested it. Oh, and I did learn, for those of you who are wondering. (If you're wondering who's wondering, then... Whatever. <br> Shout out to my great classmates, who are probably the only ones reading My Most Wacko Website.)

  July 18<sup>th</sup>! <br> I haven't written for a few days, as I was busy, y'know, we the fast, shabbos, and all that. The fast wasn't too hard, but it was a bit hot, and on Tuesday, tommorow, it will be <strong><em>BOILING!!! LIkE, 36Â° C! THAT IS CRAZY HOT!!!!</em></strong><br> Whatever. (Did you notice that I like using 'whatever' a lot? Who cares. Whatever. (Oh, did you notice that I also use 'who cares' a lot? whatever)). <br> So, after a while, it will probably be hard to think of things to write about, but <em> whatever</em>. (Hah!!) <br> Either way, the JS is not loading on my test page, and that is really really really really annoying, so I'll just have to figure it out. If you know how to help me, send me a chat. (I still have to figure out how to make it that it won't be live, only if I want to. <em> Whatever </em>.
