Hi! I am  YMCohen, and this is my webpage. I am not very good at coding, and just getting used GitHub. I was confused at first about how to make a website, but I did it! Either way, you can contact me by using the 'thingy' at the bottom. I'll start writing more, don't worry. Kind of. 
  </p>

Log number 2! This time, I am trying to make sure the css is good. And I'm trying to link the header, but whatever. Maybe soon I will do some more JS animation. <br> Hey! Guess what! there are apparently a few other Y. M. Cohen's out there, with real businesses, so I hope I don't get into a lawsuit with this. Whatever. Who cares?</p>

Log number 3; Day number 3! This is the third day that my website is up and running. Woo Hoo! <br>
So, today I've worked a bit on the styling (I want it to look nice), and I've worked on adding my new <strong><a href="/music.html">Music Page!</a></strong> I'm really proud of myself, so... Go Mee!!!! <br>
Now that I think about it, this should probably be on another page. Something like... /blog.html! Maybe later. <br> Oh, you know how annoying it is when the stylesheet takes a really LONNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG time to effect the page? It's really annoying. Like, really. <br> Come ON!!! UPDATE ALREADY!!! </p>

<p class="body1" >
This is number 4! Can you beleive it? Now my blogs are getting longer. We'll have to make an index, and set it up properly. <br> if you want to see my testing site, go to <a href = "/test.html"> https://ymcohen.github.io/test.html</a>. That's where I'm testing out the audio options. I wnat to make it easier to modify with JS. And that brings me to my second announcement: Drumroll, please....<br> I have added JS to my website. If you don't see anything, then good for you, because I didn't use it for anything, I just tested it. Oh, and I did learn, for those of you who are wondering:(Shout out to my great classmates, who are probably the only ones reading My Most Wacko Website.)
